### Motivation
  This submodel is designed to clearly illustrate the relationships and dependencies between its core components. The AlertGenerator and Alert classes share an aggregation relationship, as AlertGenerator creates instances of Alert to issue notifications, yet Alert can exist independently of AlertGenerator. Additionally, AlertGenerator relies on DataStorage to access patient data, establishing a dependencyâ€”without DataStorage, AlertGenerator cannot generate alerts, highlighting their interconnected roles. Similarly, DataStorage and Patient exhibit an aggregation relationship; DataStorage manages patient data using a Map<Integer, Patient>, but it cannot store data without Patient instances, emphasizing its dependency on Patient. This design ensures that each class has a distinct responsibility while maintaining necessary interactions for the system to function cohesively. The structure prioritizes simplicity and clarity in demonstrating these relationships.

Note: As this model was developed during Week 2, no design patterns were applied, focusing instead on foundational UML concepts and relationships.
