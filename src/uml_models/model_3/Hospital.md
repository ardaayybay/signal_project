This UML class diagram represents a system for managing patient identities within a hospital setting. It consists of three key classes: IdentityManager, PatientIdentifier, and HospitalPatient, with a composition relationship linking them.

IdentityManager: This class serves as the central controller for patient identification. It contains:
Attributes: patientIdentifier and logger, indicating it uses a PatientIdentifier object and a logging mechanism.
Methods: identify(data): MatchResult to process identification data and return a matching result, and handleFailure() to manage identification failures.
Role: Acts as the main interface, orchestrating the identification process and logging activities.
PatientIdentifier: This class represents the logic for matching patient data. It has:
Attribute: incomingID: String, storing the incoming patient identifier to be matched.
Method: match(id): HospitalPatient, which attempts to match the incomingID with a HospitalPatient instance.
Relationship: Connected to IdentityManager via a composition (diamond symbol), indicating that IdentityManager owns and manages instances of PatientIdentifier. This suggests that PatientIdentifier cannot exist independently of IdentityManager.
HospitalPatient: This class models a patient’s data in the hospital system. It includes:
Attributes: id: String for a unique identifier, name: String for the patient’s name, and history: List to store the patient’s medical history.
Method: getSummary():, likely returning a summary of the patient’s information (return type not specified).
Relationship: Linked to PatientIdentifier via an association, implying that PatientIdentifier can reference or match against HospitalPatient instances.
The diagram highlights a hierarchical structure where IdentityManager uses PatientIdentifier to process incoming IDs and match them against HospitalPatient records. The composition between IdentityManager and PatientIdentifier ensures tight coupling, while the association with HospitalPatient allows for flexible data matching. This design supports patient identification and error handling within a hospital context.
