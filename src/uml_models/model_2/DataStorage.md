### Motivation
This UML class diagram, created in diagrams.net, models a health data management system. It includes five classes: DataStorage, Patient, PatientRecord, Alert, and AlertGenerator.

DataStorage is central, storing patient data in a patientMap (type Map<Integer, Patient>). It provides methods to add patient data, retrieve records by time range, and get all patients. Patient represents an individual with a unique patientId and maintains a list of PatientRecord objects, linked via a 1-to-0..n composition relationship with DataStorage. PatientRecord captures details like measurementValue, recordType, and timestamp, with getters for each attribute. Alert encapsulates alert data (patientId, condition, timestamp) with corresponding getter methods. AlertGenerator evaluates patient data from DataStorage to generate alerts, holding a reference to DataStorage and offering methods to evaluate data and trigger alerts.

Relationships include an association from AlertGenerator to DataStorage, a composition between DataStorage and Patient (1-to-0..n), and another composition from Patient to PatientRecord (1-to-0..n). The diagram effectively illustrates the system’s structure, emphasizing data storage, patient management, and alert generation, with clear attribute and method definitions. It’s well-suited for understanding the data flow and interactions within the system.
